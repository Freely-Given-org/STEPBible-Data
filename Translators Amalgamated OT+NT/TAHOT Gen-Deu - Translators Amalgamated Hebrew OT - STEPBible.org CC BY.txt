Translators Amalgamated Hebrew OT tagged with disambiguated Strongs extended for BDB including tags for prefixes & suffixes, with ETCBC morphology																

The aim of this data is to supply the text actually used by Bible translators, which is often different to that found in the Leningrad codex.  																
The body of the text has the Qere (ie the scribal marginal reading which was generally used even by the KJV translators) while recording the Ketiv (ie the text that  the Qere replaces) as a variant.  																
Other readings used by translators are also recorded as variants, while additional text (mostly from the LXX) is added as Hebrew from the BHS & BHK apparatus.  																
The Leningrad text and the source of any variant or addition is always indicated. 																
																
FIELD DESCRIPTIONS:																
==============																
Ref in Heb (Eng)	Hebrew Bible versification (with Eng refs in brackets when they are different). Word numbers of the Ketiv text, dividing words by spaces and metheg.  English refs occasionally start a verse on a different word - i.e. Num.26.1; 1Sa.21.1; 1Ki.18.33; 20.3; 22.22; 22.43; 1Ch.12.4; Isa.64.1; and Psalm Titles.															
Text type:	"M + T" marks most words, where T is the Text in BHS/Leningrad as pointed by the Masoretes and M is the text that the Masoretes recommend (ie the Qere and Itture &  Tiqqune Sopherim). 
	When they are different, "M + (T)" indicates a difference in meaning, and "M + [T]" indicates a difference in spelling alone. Twice "[M + T]" indicates the text has been reconstructed, at Jos.21.36-37 from 1Ch.6.63-64 and at Neh.7.67b from Ezr.2.66.															
	"M + T +(B)" incidates that BHS differs from Leningrad, and the square brackets of "M + T +[B]" indicates it is only a Spelling variant. Other letters are used for different sources of variants  (see "Meaning variant" below for  A, C, D, E, I, P, Q, V, W). 															
Hebrew	Pointing, cantillation and punctuation follow the Qere with the Ketiv as a variant when the meaning differs. The Qere includes those found in Leningrad and others listed in the BHS apparatus (ie Gen.9.21#07; Gen.12.8#08; Gen.33.4#07; Gen.35.21#04; Exo.32.17#06; Exo.35.11#12; Lev.23.13#11; Num.3.51#05; Deu.27.10#07; Jdg.19.13#03; Jdg.19.21#03; 1Sa.18.14#04; 1Sa.18.22#04; 2Sa.13.33#15; 1Ki.17.15; 2Ki.19.23#21; 2Ki.20.13#08; 2Ch.35.4#01; 2Ch.36.14#07; Ezr.4.11#10; Est.4.4#01; Psa.21.2#07; Psa.123.4#08; Pro.6.13#02; Pro.6.13#04; Pro.23.3#02; Isa.58.14#07; Jer.2.3#05; Jer.15.8#03; Jer.22.18#24; Jer.27.20; Lam.3.25#03; Ezk.3.20#18; Ezk.31.18#25; Ezk.32.32#15; Ezk.39.11#24; Ezk.40.31#01; Ezk.43.11#12; Ezk.43.15#04; Ezk.44.3#07; Dan.2.29#01; Dan.2.31#01; Dan.2.37#01; Dan.2.38#14; Dan.4.22#21; Dan.4.22#27; Dan.4.29#22; Dan.6.1#02; Hab.3.4#09; Zec.2.8#02)															
	Forward slash ( / ) separates  prefixes and suffixes from the root word. These divisions are mirrored in the transliteration, translation, lexical tagging and grammar. Backward slash ( \ ) separates punctuation in Hebrew and morphology 															
	Hebrew is derived from Westminster Leningrad text WLC 4.20 via OpenScriptures, with occasional corrections towards the Leningrad Codex by BHS or by Tyndale scholars. It is, essentially, a corrected version of BHS. 															
English translation:  	Forward slash ( / ) separates the translation to mirror the prefixes, root and suffixes in Hebrew. This means the natural order of English words may be disrupted. 
	Words in <angle brackets> are in the Hebrew but are best not  included in a translation. Words in [square brackets] aren't in the Hebrew but are implied and are best included in a translation. 															
dStrongs = Lexical = Gloss	Lexical tags for each element of the Hebrew, including punctuation with the Root tag in {curly brackets}. 
	These disambiguated Strong numbers (dStrong)  are defined at TinyURL.com/STEP-Disambiguated. Each isd accompanied by lexical form in Heberew, and an English gloss, with the sub-meaning after " » " where appropriate. 															
	Names of people and places have unique IDs such as "Abram»Abraham@Gen.11.26-1Pe" which means: in this location the name given is Abram but the most common name is Abraham. This individual occurs first at Gen.11.26 and last in 1Peter. The ID and the accompanying dStrong number belongs to only one individual who is distinct from anyone else who shares any of their names. 															
Grammar	Morphology is from ETCBC, with Ketiv forms parsed by Tyndale scholars - see e.g. Deu.33.2-15.   For the source of ETCBC and conversion method by Tyndale House, see https://goo.gl/yKaXQq#HebMorph2															
	Morphology codes follow the form defined by OpenScriptures at http://openscriptures.github.io/morphhb/parsing/HebrewMorphologyCodes.html#vt with some adaptations - see TinyURL.com/HebMorph															
Meaning variant	Theese are significant variants that are adopted by standard Bible translations which should result in a different translation. They include Kere (K - the Qere is placed in the main text), plus occasional significant variants from: 															
	Aleppo (A), Cairensis (C), Ben Chaim (H),  Masorah Itture Sopherim (I), double pointing (P), other Hebrew manuscripts (V), Qumran and other Judean caves (Q) alternate word divisions (D) and other Emmendations (E). Many variants remain to be  added. 															
Spelling variants	Ketiv variants that would result in identical translation are recorded as spelling variants. Spelling variants from other sources are not listed. Spelling variants are not recorded in the Interlinear layout.  															
	These variants may sometimes be morphologically distinct from the text, but not sufficiently to result in a different translation. For example, Ruth 3.14 has Ketiv "his foot" replaced by Qere "his feet" (because single 'foot' is a euphamism for penis). It also has "before" spelled as בִּ/טְרוֹם in Ketiv and בְּ/טֶ֛רֶם in Qere. Both are recorded in the Word-per-line display, but the spelling difference for "before" is not recorded in the Interlinear display.  															
sStrong+Instance	Simple Strongs (sStrongs) are the numbers found in simpler tagged BIbles - ie without the prefixes, suffixes or disambiguation.  Instances allow these to be upgraded to disambiguated tags with morphology - see www.TinyURL.com/UpgradingTags															
	Instances mark more than one occurrence of the same sStrong in the same verse: "_A" is appended for the 1st instance  (eg G1234_A), "_B" for the 2nd instance etc.  A lower case (eg "_b") indicates the word might not be included in some tagged Bibles, because it is not found in all manuscripts or because there is also an alternate way to tag this word.   															
Alt Strongs	Alternate ways to tag the same word using Strongs tags. Differences are usually due to different interpretations of the Hebrew root.  	The purpose of this and the sStrong+Instance is to help line up this data with other tagged Bibles.  														
Conjoin word	Not yet implemented

# Tyndale House is an international Biblical Research Institute 
About 50 scholars at a time work at Tyndale House, often from more than a dozen countries. Most work on private research, and some work on special projects for Tyndale House, such as this one. 
The data in this repository is created and curated collaboratively by Tyndale scholars, directed by David Instone-Brewer with the oversight of Peter Williams, and by their successors. 

The repository aims to provide reliable and freely usable data for studying the Bible without any denominational or doctrinal bias. Much of the data is derivative from other publically licenced sources, and has been compared with other non-public sources so that differences can be checked by Tyndale scholars. Corrections and proposed updates are welcomed - please send them to TyndaleStep@gmail.com for checking.

# Data format is tab-delimited fields 
Data is in plain unicode text with tabs separating fields so it can be loaded into any text editor or spreadsheet. 

In most data, each line has identical fields, so end-of-line marks the end of a record.
For some data (e.g. ProperNames) records consist of multiple lines and the record starts with "$". In this case the first line has data which applies to each following line in the record.
